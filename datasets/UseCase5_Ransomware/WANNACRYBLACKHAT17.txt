Scenario

Vic Tim (victim@miamip0wnmachine.com) receives an email from Rod.Soto@jask.io with
a shorten uri (http://bit.ly/2om4gv1) . Vic Tim clicks on shorten link and goes to http://159.203.64.71:3000
from there he downloads payload.exe and connects back to C2 (http://159.203.64.71:8080) via
http. From there attacker executes several commands obtaining host network awareness and neighbours. 
attacker then discovers win732 (192.168.4.37) and tries to exploit it but fails then attacks win764PRO machine (192.168.4.38) and exploits via Eternal Blue and gets shell
and fails as well finally using PS EXec to get to Win732 and fails as well. Attacker uses CMD DOS to copy file from
WIN10ENT Machine to XP then exfiltrates it. Finaly WannaCry is downloaded into windows XP and executed.
